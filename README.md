## 📊 Projects

### 1. **Grid Stability Prediction using Machine Learning**
- This project focuses on predicting power grid stability based on sensor-like simulation data of producers and consumers in an electrical grid.
- The goal is to anticipate unstable states before they occur — enabling early maintenance and preventing power failures.

### **Problem Statement:**
- In modern energy grids, maintaining stability between producers (power plants) and consumers (loads) is critical.
- Even small fluctuations in parameters like reaction time, nominal power, or price elasticity can cause instability. 
- This project applies machine learning to predict whether the grid is in a stable or unstable state — enabling proactive rerouting or maintenance before customer impact.
